A GUI program for easy pdf file merging <br />
Made using Python, PyPDF2 and Tkinter. <br />

## How to use?
Just click "Choose files" button, select pdf's and press "Merge". Merged pdf file will appear on your desktop.

## Example:
Clicking "Choose files" will allow you to choose pdf files from the same directory.<br />

After choosing files press "Open" and you'll have an option to rename the merged file or just merge using the default name.<br />

## Having errors?
Make sure to have PyPDF2, Tkinter and PIL installed 
<pre><code>pip install PyPDF2 
pip install Tkinter 
pip install Pillow
</code></pre>


## Still having errors?
Probably because my code is bad ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
